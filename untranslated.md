Some Unicode characters are considered to be equivalent in identifiers.
Different ways of entering Unicode combining characters (e.g., accents)
are treated as equivalent (specifically, Julia identifiers are NFC-normalized).
The Unicode characters `ɛ` (U+025B: Latin small letter open e)
and `µ` (U+00B5: micro sign) are treated as equivalent to the corresponding
Greek letters, because the former are easily accessible via some input methods.

For more information about stylistic conventions, see the [Style Guide](@ref).
